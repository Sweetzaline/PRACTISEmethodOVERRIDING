 Method Over-Riding
-An approach of re-implementing a parent class method under the child class with the same   signature.
- Child & Parent Class have same method-Declaration 
- Different Method Logic
-OR is about changing behaviors of a Parent’s method under child class. Parent class allows the child class to consume the method and change the logic, if required.
-We can define Multiple methods with same name and same parameters
-Can be performed only in parent-child classes. Never be performed in same class. (Ambiguity)
-Child class needs to take permission from the parent class for method overriding.
-If we want to override a parent’s method under the child class, first that method should be  declared by using virtual modifier in parent class.
-Any virtual method of the parent class can be overridden by the child if required by using the -Override modifier keyword to create Over-Riding.
-Occurs in the inheritance
-Static & Private methods can’t be OR, as it doesn’t occur in class.
-Return type must be same, of Parent class override method
-Achieve Run- time Polymorphism
